Customer lifetime value analysis is used to estimate the total value of customers to the business over the lifetime of their relationship. It helps businesses make data-driven decisions on how to allocate their resources and improve their customer relationships.

Customer lifetime value (CLTV) is the estimated total amount a customer will spend on a business throughout their relationship with that business. It takes into account the revenue generated by the customer as well as the costs associated with acquiring and serving that customer. By analyzing the relationship between customer acquisition costs and revenue generated, we can determine which channels are the most cost-effective for acquiring and retaining high-value customers.

The given data includes information about the customerâ€™s channel, cost of acquisition, conversion rate, and revenue generated. Your task is to analyze the CLTV of customers across different channels and identify the most profitable channels for the business.
